# Hero Legacy
### Rulebook

By Dan Stalcup

## Introduction

Welcome to Hero Legacy, the game for 3-4 players where you craft your own hero&#39;s story by making choices that matter.

Your story starts in a fantasy world of magic, monsters, and mayhem. You have been selected to join an elite academy for training heroes. You will try to make your way through the rigors of school life. You are competing with your peers become the greatest hero in the land.

Each game has its own story, and the decisions you make can carry over for games to come.

## Goal

Your choices and actions have consequences, and those consequences give you (or take away) Virtue Points, the measure of your heroism. The player whose character ends with the most Virtue Points wins the game.

## Gameplay Overview

Hero Legacy takes place over a series of turns. Each hero experiences an event and has to make a choice each turn. There are two types of turns:

- Group Event Turns
On these turns, every hero experiences the same event. These turns occur on set intervals throughout the game and advance the overall story.
- Individual Event Turns
On these turns, each hero experiences their own event. These small, episodic events describe everyday life at school and help you craft your character.

## Developing Your Hero

Every player takes control of a character for the duration of the game, and can carry that hero over to future games.

Each character can develop in a few ways:

- Background and Discipline: Each character will be given a background and a discipline at the start of the game. A hero&#39;s background will give you a starting definition of your character&#39;s personality, while his discipline will give you a special way to earn virtue points. Characters&#39; backgrounds and disciplines may unlock special actions.
- Personality: Not only is each character an aspiring hero, they&#39;re also teens coming of age. As such, their challenges big and small will help forge them into grown up heroes. As heroes accumulate personality tokens, they can better resolve future challenges. Each hero builds their personality along three axes:
  - Strength - physical power and endurance
  - Wit - mental agility and cleverness
  - Bravery - boldness and resiliency against fear
- Training: Your first job as an aspiring hero is to excel in your training. Training is worth Virtue Points (especially if you make the honor roll) and help you excel in future events. Each hero trains in four different schools of heroism:
  - Warfare - physical combat; battle preparedness.
  - Stealth - avoiding detection; sleight of hand
  - Magic - casting spells; studying ancient secrets
  - Rhetoric - speaking persuasively; winning influence
- Tourneys: Every character is striving to become the best hero, and it&#39;s through school-sanctioned tournaments that they directly compete. At regular points during the game, each hero wins or lose Virtue Points depending on how well they&#39;ve prepared for tournaments.
- Loot: A hero is only as effective as his equipment. Characters gain three types of loot: weapons, armor, and runes. The better your set of equipment, the more Virtue Points you&#39;ll score.
- Virtue: As a hero, your main goal is to be virtuous. If your character accomplishes something significant, he will have a virtue bestowed upon him. Virtues can give you large virtue point bonuses based on how you have developed your character, can unlock new actions, and can carry over to future games.

## First Game Setup

Find and prepare the following:

- **Game A event cards.** Shuffle. Deal to each player four stacks of five cards face down. Players should not look at these.
- **Game A story sheets.** Set them aside for now. Do not reveal.
- **Game A virtue cards.** Do not shuffle. Put face down. Players should not look at these.
- **Character Sheets and Quick Scoring Guides.** Give one of each to each player.
- **Game Progress Board.** Tracking the progress of the game.
- **Choice Cards.** Give one set (A-E) to each player.
- **Discipline and Background Cards.** Set them aside for now.
- **Tourney Scoring Tokens.** Set them aside for now.
- **VP Discs**. Set them aside for now.
- **General Tokens.** Place some in reach of all players. Use on character sheets.

## Playing the Game

Overview of Gameplay

The general flow of play is as follows

1. Group Event Round
  - One player reads the story sheet aloud
  - Everyone completes same Group Event
2. Series of **five** Individual Event Rounds
  - Each player draws a card
  - Each player completes the event on their card
  - Players take turns reading their event and its resolution aloud
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 **four** times.
4. Complete a final Group Event Round to determine the outcome of the game

## Scoring

At the completion of the last event of the game, every player calculates his score in each of the following areas:

### Training

Score 2 VP for each training level on each of the four tracks.

- Example: If Sandra is level three in Warfare, level two in Stealth, level two in Magic, and has no training in Rhetoric, she would score as follows:
- 3 x 2 VP for Warfare + 2 x 2 VP for Stealth + 2 x 2 VP for Magic + 0 x 2 VP for Rhetoric
- 6 VP + 4 VP + 4 VP + 0 VP = 18 VP for training

### Honor Roll

Whichever character has the most training in each track gets five points. In the case of a tie, split those points (always rounding down).

- Example: Sandra has the highest level among characters in Warfare. She is in a two-way tie for highest level among characters in Stealth. She is in a three-way tie for highest level among characters in Magic. She does not have the highest level in Rhetoric
- 5 VP for Warfare + 5 รท 2 VP for Stealth + 5 รท 1 VP for Magic + no VP for Rhetoric
- 5 VP + 2 VP + 1 VP = 7 VP for honor roll

### Tourney

At the end of each quarter, before the Group Event takes place, the school holds a tournament. Each character competes with the character **to his left and right** in each tournament, meaning two competitions per character per tournament.

For each competition: If a character has more tourney points than its opponent, the player takes a win token (for that quarter). If a character has fewer tourney points than its opponent, the player takes a defeat token. If the character has the same number of tourney tokens, the player does not take any tokens.

Tourney Victory tokens are worth 1, 2, 3, and 5 points for each quarter, respectively. Tourney Loss tokens are worth negative one points. _Players can score a net negative in tourney scoring._

- Example: Sandra has two first quarter Victory tokens, a fourth quarter Victory token, and two defeat tokens.
- 2 x 1 VP for first quarter Victories, 1 x 5 VP for fourth quarter Victory, 2 x -1 VP for losses
- 2 VP + 5 VP - 2 VP = 5 VP for Tourneys

### Loot

Heroes score 1, 3, 6, 10 and 15 points for being on level 1-5, respectively, of each track of loot the character has at the end of the game.

- Example: Sandra is level 3 in Weapons, level 3 in Armor, and level 1 in Runes.
- 6 VP for Weapons, 6 VP for Armor, and 1 VP for Runes
- 6 VP + 6 VP + 1 VP = 13 VP for Loot

### Loot Set Bonus

Characters score their lowest lowest loot score again. In the case of a tie, score just one again. If one or more loot track did not advance to level 1, you score zero points.

- Example: Sandra is level 1 in Runes, her lowest loot level. Loot at level 1 is worth 1 VP.
- 1 VP for Loot Set Bonus

### VP Discs

Each VP disc is worth one VP.

- Example: Sandra has three VP discs.
- 3 VP for VP Discs

### Virtues

Calculate scores according to each of your virtues, **including your Discipline**. Sum up the these scores.

- Example: Sandra scores 5 VP for her Discipline and 3 VP for another virtue.
- 8 VP for Virtues

### Grand Total

Sum up all of your scores to see your total hero score!

- Example: Sandra scores 18 VP for Training, 7 VP for Honor Roll, 5 VP for Tourneys, 13 VP for Loot, 1 VP for Loot Set Bonus, 3 VP for VP Discs, and 8 VP for Virtues
- 18 + 7 + 5 + 13 + 1 + 8 = **52 VP**
