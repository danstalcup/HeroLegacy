## Instructions

## Introduction

### Getting Started

Welcome to Hero Legacy. You play the role of an aspiring teen hero, now arrived at Hero Academy, about to start your first semester of hero training. Before school and training can start, each player must determine their character's basic traits.

You will track your development on your Character Sheet. Start by writing your name in the "Player" box.

Deal three "Background" cards to each player. Players should then choose one of the three backgrounds for their character, keeping that card and discarding the other two. Write the name of the background in the "Background" box on the character sheet.

Come up with a name for your character and write it in the "Character" box of the character sheet.

Once everyone has picked a name and background, go around the circle and take turns introducing your characters.

### Welcome to Hero Academy

Today is orientation day. You are each a member of a class of a few dozen students starting their first year of a five year program for training elite heroes in the realms of cunning, wizardry, and warfare.

Hero Academy is the most elite training institution in the region. It resides in a wooded area near a large pond and the crossroads between three villages: Town A, Town B, and Town C, each a several hour walk from Hero Academy. A large capital city, City D, is a day's horse ride or a week's walk in the distance.

This region has been inhabited primarily by humans for hundreds of years. A small number of centaurs and other nomadic creatures roam the wilds. In the past few decades, camps and small villages of goblins have been migrated to the land from the south.

It's time for classes and activities, sanctioned and unsanctioned, to begin at Hero Academy.

Complete the first stack of Individual Events.

## Group Event 1 - Pick a Discipline

You've finished your first midterm exams, and the time has come for you to choose Hero Academy's equivalent of a major: your Discipline. These Disciplines define your purpose, guide your values as a hero, and determine how you will be graded.

[more flavor text goes here]

Pass out three Discipline cards to each player. Each player chooses one card, which provides a scoring bonus at the end of the game.

## Group Event 2 - First Ranging

Your first year at Hero Academy is halfway finished! It's time for your first challenge -- a ranging through the wilds to make sure the woods remain safe.

Halfway into the evening, you hear a noise. It's a goblin looting an equipment chest of the school's

You approach him, and he refuses to return it.

Every player should find their highest Training stat. (If you have a tie, you choose one.) Here's how you attempt to convince him not to take the equipment based on that stat:

* Warfare: Threaten to attack him (-1 Goblin)
* Stealth: Sneak behind him and scare him (-1 Goblin)
* Magic: Conjure a trinket and offer it to him (+1 Goblin)
* Rhetoric: Try to reason with him that he should do better (+1 Goblin)

## Group Event 3 - Goblins Attack!

You've made it three quarters of the way through the year when the peace of Hero Academy is shattered: Goblins attack in the middle of the night.

Every player should find their highest Training stat. (If you have a tie, you choose one.) Here's how you respond to the ambush:

* Warfare: Fight them back with brute force (-1 Goblin)
* Stealth: Launch a sneak attack that startles, but doesn't harm, them (+1 Goblin)
* Magic: You cast an attack spell on the ambushers (-1 Goblin)
* Rhetoric: You make a rousing speech to convince the attackers to flee (+1 Goblin)

## Group Event 4 - The Clash

As the school year winds up, the school leaders prepare students for a clash with the local goblin tribe.

Find the player with the highest Tournament score to make the next decision. If there is a tie, no one makes the following choice.

As you prepare for the clash, do you:
* Plan aggressive attack strategies? (-2 Goblin)
* Practice defensive counter maneuvers? (+2 Goblin)

Find the player with the highest total Loot score to make the next decision. If there is a tie, no one makes the following choice.

When you prepare your loot for the clash, do you:
* Bring your dangerous loot to prepare for battle? (-2 Goblin)
* Bring your ceremonial loot to use as negotiating leverage? (+2 Goblin)


The clash begins. The teachers lead a line of soldiers to the goblin tribe's home camp.

The goblins are ready. They shout out: "Why do you come?"

Look at your Goblin score to determine how the clash unfolds:

* Goblin Score of less than 0: Your classmates and teachers trade a few words with the goblins before they charge you, impatient with your aggressive tactics. It's a short battle, but filled with injuries, including a heavy blow to the head of the goblin chief. He calls his goblins to retreat. They flee into the woods, but not before the goblin chief shouts: "Humans, you may have won this skirmish, but I assure you: This is now a war, and one our tribe intends to win!"
* Goblin Score of 0 or higher: Your headmaster and the goblin chief exchange some tense words of parley before the goblin chief invites your headmaster into a tent to negotiate. An hour later, both emerge and announce the agreement: Goblins agree not to attack any more humans, but Hero Academy will begin admitting Goblins next school year,
